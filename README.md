1. Project Title:  "Evaluation of Salaries vs. Shortstop Statistical Performance in the MLB since 1991"
2. Team Members:  Nick Titus, Javier Lopez, Bryan Fawcett, Jordan Tata
3. Project Description/Outline:  Using datasets from data.world that have collected historical statistical and salary information, 
    we will explore the relationship between pay and performance in Major League Baseball. This analysis will attempt to find 
    correlations between statistical performance and monetary reward at the shortstop position, and determine infer whether salary 
    at the shortstop position is related to team success. 
4. Research questions to answer:
    a. Is salary of the short stop is it related to performance? 
        
        batting average
        home runs
        Wins above Replacement - reference wrestling class example. This will need to create columns for each year per player.
    
    b. Does individual salary/team payroll correlate to individual/team success?
    
        Possibly look into merging team and player data to see if the player lead the team to a playoffs.
        
    c. Does salary in short stop contribute proportionally to statistical contribution?
    
    d. How has salary increased over time, adjusting for inflation?
